I am very much biased towards R. So far, I've not felt that there was anything that I couldn't do in R but I realize that some might beg to differ. So, here, I want to compare a Python workflow with R and see if one is noteably better (faster, easier, more straight forward, etc.)

I am running R with RStudio and Python (Miniconda 3) with Pyzo.
