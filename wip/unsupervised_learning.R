##Unsupervised Anomaly detection
For instructions on how to build unsupervised models with H2O Deep Learning, we refer to our previous [Tutorial on Anomaly Detection with H2O Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUSbljByXak) and our [MNIST Anomaly detection code example](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-r/tests/testdir_algos/deeplearning/runit_deeplearning_anomaly_large.R), as well as our [Stacked AutoEncoder R code example](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-r/tests/testdir_algos/deeplearning/runit_deeplearning_stacked_autoencoder_large.R).
