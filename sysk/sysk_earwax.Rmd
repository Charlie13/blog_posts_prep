# Text mining and sentiment analysis of a Stuff You Should Know Podcast

For many years, I've been listening to Josh and Chuck teach me "stuff I should know". I've learned so many things I've never thought much about before and I love them!

Inititally, I wanted to explore all SYSK podcast. Unfortunately however, I could only find a transcript for the episode [Earwax: Live With It](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/earwax-live-with-it-2.htm), posted on March 19, 2015.

<br>

## Loading the transcript

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, cache=FALSE}
# read Lines of transcript
raw <- readLines("sysk_earwax.transcript.txt")

# and convert to a data frame
df <- do.call("rbind", lapply(raw, as.data.frame))
head(df)
```

## Separating Josh and Chuck

Of course, I wouldn't actually want to separate Josh and Chuck. But for comparison's sake, I will create two separate files for lines spoken by Josh and Chuck.
